### Using the existing BCE VM

If you'd like to use the VM as a student, researcher, or instructor, our goal is to make this easy for you.

If you're using VirtualBox, [follow these instructions](using-virtualbox.html).

If you'd like to use the VM on Amazon's EC2 cloud platform, [follow these instructions](using-ec2.html).

### Creating (and modifying) the BCE VM

All the files for creating the VM are in the collaboratool repository on GitHub.

To clone the repository from the command line:

         git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool

Then go to the provisioning directory and see the information in HOWTO.md.

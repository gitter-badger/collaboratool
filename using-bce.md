### Using the existing BCE VM

Our goal is to make this easy for students, researchers, and instructors.

[In VirtualBox](using-virtualbox.html)

[In Amazon EC2](using-ec2.html)

### Creating (and modifying) the BCE VM

All the files for creating the VM are in the collaboratool repository on GitHub.

To clone the repository from the command line:

         git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool

Then go to the provisioning directory and see the information in HOWTO.md.

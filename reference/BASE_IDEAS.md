Collaboratool Image Generation
==============================

The safest base image appears to be the vanilla 64-bit ubuntu server image.

There are several approaches we've tested, including:

 1. A 2-step process of manual base OVA creation followed by scripted deployment
 2. Fully scripted process using vagrant
 3. Fully scripted using packer

### Desired high-level features of BCE

This working document is intended as a way for the BCE working group to agree on the desired features of BCE.

Tentative list of features:

 * VMs:

   - A fixed, versioned VM provided each semester for classes and workshops

   -  Ideally, the same VM usable for research, with functionality for parallel computing and provisioned such that it can be used as the VM for virtual cluster nodes

  - The VM runnable on user laptops (Mac/Windows/Linux) and on cloud machines

  - The VM usable on a machine with minimal dependencies (e.g., either VirtualBox or VMware) and minimal setup, and with clear instructions for users on setup and on getting data/files into and out of the VM

 * Scripting:

  - The script used to create a given VM available to users and with clear instructions on how to use and modify the script

  - The ability for a user to add software to a VM and then 'export' that information back into a script that can be used to recreate the modified VM

 * Logistics and training
 
  - A repository/website with all BCE materials available

  - Procedures for user input and feedback on bugs, desired software tools on the VM, etc., e.g., via a mailing list

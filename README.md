Collaboratool

This project is primarily organized around creating and popularizing the
Berkeley Common Environment (BCE).

Full documentation for the project is available on our gh-pages website:

History
-------

This master branch is a reboot of the repo now in
[collaboratool-archive](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool-archive).
Sadly, while some of the materials copied here were authored by
@BagOfMostlyWater, that history is lost. But, I hope you find that the 2 degrees
of magnitude reduction in repository size is worth it!

Another source of materials while we're settling is in
[collaboratool-base](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool-base), which
represents @davclark's first stab at a minimal provisioning approach.

### Getting the EC2 VM up and running

  * Go to [EC2 management console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and choose the US-West-2 (Oregon) region, as that is where we have posted the BCE AMI. (You'll need to have an account set up.)
  * On the "AMIs" tab, search for the BCE AMI amongst public images (currently it's named "bce_0.1").
  * Launch an instance
  * Follow the instructions given in the "Connect" button to SSH to the instance
  * If you want to connect as the "oski" user, you can deposit your public SSH key in the .ssh folder of the "oski" user.

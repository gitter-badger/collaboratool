### Getting the EC2 VM up and running

  * Go to [EC2 management console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and choose the
    us-west-1 (N. California) or us-west-2 (Oregon) region, as that is where we
    have posted the BCE AMI. (You'll need to have an account set up.)
  * On the "AMIs" tab, search for the most recent BCE AMI amongst public images (currently
    ami-0d797748 in us-west-1).
  * Launch an instance
  * Follow the instructions given in the "Connect" button to SSH to the instance
  * If you want to connect as the "oski" user, you can deposit your public SSH
    key in the .ssh folder of the "oski" user.
